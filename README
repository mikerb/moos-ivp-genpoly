#=============================================================================
# Introduction
#=============================================================================
The moos-ivp-genpoly repository contains code for (a) representing general,
non-convex polygons, (b) algorithms for covering a genpoly with a set of
convex polygons, and (c) an engineering GUI for testing.

#=============================================================================
# Directory Structure
#=============================================================================
The directory structure for the moos-ivp-extend is decribed below:

bin              - Directory for generated executable files
build            - Directory for build object files
build.sh         - Script for building moos-ivp-extend
CMakeLists.txt   - CMake configuration file for the project
lib              - Directory for generated library files
README           - Contains helpful information - (this file).
src              - Directory for source code

#=============================================================================
# Build Instructions
#=============================================================================
To build on Linux and Apple platforms, execute the build script within this
directory:

   $ ./build.sh

#=============================================================================
# Environment variables
#=============================================================================
The moos-ivp-genpoly binaries files should be added to your path to allow them
to be launched from pAntler. 

#=============================================================================
# Using the code
#=============================================================================

The primary function of the moos-ivp-genpoly repo is contained within the
lib_gen_poly library. It contains:

(a) A data structure (C++ class) for representing a general polygon, and
(b) An algorithm for creating an genpoly from a sequence of vertices

An engineering GUI is also provided, app_polyview, for testing the creation
of genpolys from example sets of points. 

# Using the lib_genpoly library.

A general polygon is comprise of an ordered sequence of points, within an implied
line segment between each vertex, and such that no line segment crosses any other
line segment. This could be a regular polygon, e.g., square, hexagon, or any
convex polygon, or a non-convex polygon.

A non-convex polygon can have a covering. A covering is a set of convex polygon
that includes all vertices and space of of a nonconvex polygon. Generally, many
MOOS-IvP geometry library functions are defined over convex polyons. For example
rather than implmenting a function that computes the area of a general polygon,
we instead convert the general polygon into a set of convex polyongs first. Then
the area of the general polygon is just the sum of the areas of the covering
convex polygon.

The XYGenPolygon C++ class is comprised of two member variables. The ordered
list of vertices defining the general polygon, and one or more convex polygons
that cover the general polygon.

The non-trivial step is the creation of a minimal covering with the
lowest number of convex polyons. Finding the absolute minimal covering
is the goal, but for general polygons with many vertices, this can be
computationally expensive. A near minimal covering is often perfectly
fine. In the example above, for finding the area of a general polygon,
calculating the sum of say 20 convex polygons is exceptionally fast,
and not noticeably slower than "better" covering with 18
polygons. However, the search time between finding the covering of 20 vs.
the covering of 18 may be very substantial.

The C++ class, CoverEngine, is provided in this library for creating a
covering of a general polygon, with the following steps:

1. Create an instance of a CoverEngine
2. Initialize with a set of vertices
3. Invoke the genPolys() function
4. Extract the list of convex polygons
5. Return a XYGenPolygon instance with the vertices and polygons
